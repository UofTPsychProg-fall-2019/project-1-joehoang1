Detail about experiment for Project 1 Submission:

The project that I would be doing involves using Qualtrics studies to examine how different social class of conservatives and liberals influence their lay beliefs in 2 different studies.

In study 1, the Qualtrics survey that I designed is a correlational study. Because I have launched an earlier exploratory study, I will be using branch logic to exclude ID's from Mechanical Turk workers that have previously completed our exploratory study.  

In study 2, the Qualtrics survey that I designed is an experimental study. We have two conditions in this study and the manipulation would be randomly assigned to the participants. The randomizer, quota, and survey flow was used to ensure that we will have equal number of participants in each condition. We were able to use quota in this experimental survey because we did a power analysis to see how many participants we will need, the number that we got was then inputted to the quota.

Study 1 (Correlational Study):
First block consent form

If participants answers yes for consent they would be redirected to the next block and answer the questions until it is all finished. It will end with the debrief form. 

If the participants answer no, they would be redirected to a page that says thank you for their initial interest with the study and that they can now close the browser
Other questions block

Participants would proceed along the survey answering questions until they are finished and it reaches the debriefing block 

Debriefing block 
Participants would be given information about the study and asked if they consent to us using the data they have provided us. Regardless of what they answer they would be redirected to the end screen thanking them for helping with our study and that they can close the browser now

Study 2 (Experimental Study): 
First block consent form

If participants answers yes for consent they would be redirected to the manipulation block and answer the questions until it is all finished. It will end with the debrief form. 

If the participants answer no, they would be redirected to a page that says thank you for their initial interest with the study and that they can now close the browser. 

Manipulation block 
The participants would be randomly assigned to one of two conditions 

If condition 1 reaches half of the sample we plan to collect (based off the power analysis) then they would automatically be assigned to the manipulation that is not full
